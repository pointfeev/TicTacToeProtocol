# Tic-Tac-Toe Protocol
CSC 460 Individual Project

A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a server and clients communicating via TCP/IP sockets.

Make sure you have the latest Java SDK installed if you wish to compile and run; I tested the project with OpenJDK 21 and 23.

To compile and run on **Windows**, use `.\RunServer.bat` and `.\RunClient.bat`.

To compile and run on **Linux**, use `.\RunServer.sh` and `.\RunClient.sh`.
